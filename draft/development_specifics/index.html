        <p style="color: red;"><b>Status: Draft</b></p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>This document discusses specifics related to Mozilla's newly proposed
        <a href="../development_overview/">Firefox development model</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Please note this is a draft document and subject to change.</p>
        <p>Discussion should take place on <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning">dev-planning</a> and changes
        should be submitted as

        <h2 id="repositories">Main Repositories</h2>

            <p><img src="img/repos.png"></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-central</h3>
                    <p>Just like the current repository</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-aurora</h3>
                    <p>Stabilize work done on mozilla-central for release</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-beta</h3>
                    <p>Fix any issues that come up during the beta
                      validation of the mozilla-aurora stabilization</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-release</h3>
                    <p>Repository for code to generate officially released
                    Firefox binaries</p>
                    <p class="question">Why not copy to releases/mozilla-X.Y?
                    We currently do so to have a repo to use for
                    .x releases. Because this new model doesn't have .x
                    releases (only chemspill/rapid response updates) we don't
                    need to copy to the releases directory and deal with the
                    version naming. That being said, we could still do
                    so if we wanted to but there doesn't appear to be
                    much benefit/point. <strong>Please give feedback</strong>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> The general naming scheme should work
            equally well for other products if they decide to follow the same
            development/channel/repo model. Also note if in the future
            Firefox releases
            split from platform releases the naming scheme does
            not need to change...we would merely create firefox-* repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
            mozilla-central was chosen as the main development repository name
            due to familiarity, to prevent developers from
            having to alter their local repos, and to prevent
            needless changes to tools.
           </p>

           <h3 id="repo-processes">Development vs Release</h3>
           <p>The repositories can generally be grouped into two overall
              processes:
              development and release.
              Project repositories and mozilla-central are part of the
              <em>development</em> process.
              The downstream repositories are part of the
              <em>release</em> process.</p>
           <p>This document mainly covers the release process. Details about
              project pages, feature tracking, and bug management are out of
              scope for this proposal and will be discussed soon.

        <h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>


        <p>Because updates are (intended) to be silent and automatic
        we can generally assume a user on a given channel is on the
        latest available build. This assumption simplifies things greatly.
        </p>

        <h3 id="versioning-firefox">Firefox Versioning</h3>

        <p>Unless major issues are discovered with the scheme, this is how
        builds in the assorted repositories will identify themselves:</p>

        <p><img src="img/new_versions.png"></p>

        <p>
            The following considerations are reflected in the versioning scheme:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>No "pre" as there are known issues with sites sniffing
            builds as Palm Pre devices</li>
            <li>Ease of version comparisons between channels and releases</li>
            <li>Amount of changes required to existing tools and systems</li>
            <li>Ability to identify which channel a user is on from the build
            </li>
            <li>Beta and release versions should identify as the same version
            to make sure beta testing is valid and no last-minute issues are
            found due to a version change</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">
            We aren't using "a" and "b" as it would be confusing as it relates to <strong>a</strong>urora and <strong>b</strong>eta.
        </p>

        <h3 id="versioning-gecko">Gecko versioning</h3>
        <p>
            Gecko versioning will tie into Firefox versioning
            regardless of the Firefox version scheme above.
            For Firefox 5, the gecko version will be 5.0, for
            Firefox 6, 6.0, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="note">Please note that binary extensions will
        <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/200a746e0fac">already need to
        be recompiled for Firefox 5</a>.

        <p>Project repositories should be grouped by team or area in
           subdirectories under
           <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects</em>.
            In this scheme Tracemonkey can be found
           at <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects/js/tracemonkey</em>.
            Additional repos
           for the js team would be created in
           <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects/js</em>
           as well. This should keep hg.mozilla.org organized and enable
           automated tools to enumerate the available project repositories
           easily.
        </p>

        <p>Please note the above naming convention is different from what
        was used in the past. Existing project repositories may need
        to be moved around to fit in with the new scheme.</p>

        <p>Project repositories automatically get an update channel when
           nightly builds are enabled. The
           naming convention for the channel is the path from root repo,
           with slashes converted to dashes.
           For the Tracemonkey example above, builds would be generated and
           posted to <em>projects-js-tracemonkey</em>.

        <h2 id="shadowrepo">The Shadow Repository</h2>
        <p>Having a restricted shadow repository is new to Mozilla.
        We are trying to balance the fact we are open source with
        the need to secure our users by not publishing information about
        security vulnerabilities before our users are protected.</p>
        <p><strong>Most developers and users need not worry or care about
        mozilla-shadow, so feel free to ignore it (most of the graphics omit
        it for clarity).
        </strong>
        </p>
        <h3>mozilla-shadow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shadows mozilla-central and takes additional security fixes</li>
            <li>Merges into mozilla-central just before the mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-aurora merge point</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>shadow channel</h3>
        <table>

        <a name="localization" /><h2 id="localization">Localization</h2>
        <p>Localization work will be split into similar repositories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/">http://hg.mozilla.org/l10n-central/</li></a>
            <li><a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora">http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-aurora</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-beta">http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/l10n/mozilla-beta</a></li>
            <li>l10n-release</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There will be 8 or so locales that track mozilla-central,
        localizing alongside en-US development. Other locales can track
        mozilla-central if they would like to as well but they won't be
        asked to explicitly.</p>

        <p class="discussion">
        TBD: Which specific 8 or so locales are best to follow mozilla-central? This seems to be a combination of locales comfortable localizing <b>before</b> string freeze, and also locales that are useful to developers, like right-to-left for example.</p> 
        <p>mozilla-central will be string frozen for en-US at the 
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-aurora merge point. <strong>No 
        en-US string changes will be allowed on mozilla-aurora</strong>. The
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-aurora merge date will happen on
        schedule so the string freeze should not come as a surprise.
        </p>
        <p>For locales that don't track mozilla-central, their work is done in
        l10n-aurora, which tracks mozilla-aurora. <strong>This means
        most locales have 6 weeks to complete their localizations</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="milestones">Schedule of Important Milestones</h2>

        <p>In general, each stage of the process (and activity pertaining to
        a particular version) lasts for 6 weeks.<p>
        <p><img src="img/6_weeks.png"></p>

        <h3 id="milestones-ff5">Firefox 5</h3>
        <p>Firefox 5 will be slightly different from future releases due to
        the development overlap (or lack thereof) with Firefox 4:</p>

        <p><img src="img/ff5_schedule.png"></p>

        <p>Rather than 6 weeks for mozilla-central, mozilla-aurora, and
        mozilla-beta we instead have 3 weeks for development on
        mozilla-central, 5 weeks to converge and stabilize on
        mozilla-aurora, and 5 weeks to validate on mozilla-beta.</p>

        <h3 id="milestones-ff6">Firefox 6</h3>
        <p>Firefox 6 will start the normal schedule where every step in the
        cycle takes 6 weeks. Firefox 6's development cycle starts when
        Firefox 5 is cloned from mozilla-central to mozilla-aurora
        (on 2011-04-12).</p>

        <p>Please do note that chemspills / rapid response updates are not
        reflected in these schedules and will be dealt with on an as-needed
         basis.</p>

        <h2 id="branching">Cloning Mechanics</h2>
        <p>The following describes the mozilla-central to mozilla-aurora mechanics. mozilla-aurora to mozilla-beta mechanics follow the same steps, with the exception of tagging (use BETA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i>), and versioning (strip off the a2 suffix).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Never delete the aurora repo, we need the history.</li>
            <li>Tag m-c with AURORA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i>.
            <pre>
            hg tag -R mozilla-central AURORA_BASE_`date +%Y%m%d`
            hg out
            # review
            hg push
            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Pull from m-c to a new head on aurora.
            <pre>
            hg pull -R mozilla-aurora -r AURORA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i> http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central
            </pre>
            </li>
            <li>Bump aurora version.
            <pre>
            cd mozilla-aurora
            sed -i -e 's/a1/a2/g' browser/config/version.txt js/src/config/milestone.txt config/milestone.txt
            hg commit -m 'Version bump'
            </pre></li>
            <li>Set aurora branding in browser/confvars.sh (MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY=browser/branding/aurora)</li>
            <li>Human needs to review list of changes since the last
            AURORA_BASE_<i>YYYYMMDD</i> tag, and figure out which changes to
            bring forward, and which changes to throw away.</li>
            <li>Use "hg transplant" to take the changes we want to bring
            forward and bring over to the new head.</li>
            <li>Human needs to resolve any merge conflicts.<br/>
            Note: some specific files need careful human review of any
            changes, even if there are no merge conflicts.  all.js,
            firefox.js, configure.in, mozconfig</li>
            <li>Safety check:<br/>
            Diff new-head-on-aurora vs m-c == list of all previous aurora
            backouts (smaller list?)<br/>
            Diff new-head-on-aurora vs old-head-on-aurora == list of new code
            changes in m-c (bigger list?)<br/>
            Diff new-head-on-aurora vs a throw-away merge between
            new-head-on-aurora and old-head-on-aurora.<br/>
            </li>
            <li>Mark the original head as closed, to prevent accidental
            landings on the wrong head.</li>
            <li>Human needs to "hg push" back to aurora</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="chemspill">Rapid Release / Chemspill Updates</h2>
        <p>We are still in the information gathering phase and will
        have this section filled out in the next couple of days.</p>

        <h2 id="observations">General Observations</h2>
         <h3>Deferring work</h3>
         <p><strong>No work is deferred from upstream repos to downstream
            repos</strong>. If your feature / change isn't finished on
            mozilla-central, mozilla-aurora is <strong>not</strong>
            the place to fix it up. If there is outstanding work on
            mozilla-aurora <strong>do not plan</strong> to fix it in
            mozilla-beta. The clone / pull dates are published far in
            advance so there should be ample time to plan.
            <strong>
              If it's not ready it should be backed out or preffed off.
            </strong>
            There will be another release in 6-12 weeks for the fix to try
            to make it in again.</p>
         <h3>Time-based cloning</h3>
         <p>
            Cloning between repos <strong>will</strong> happen on schedule.
            Again, consistency is key. Groups will be able to plan and won't
            need to be intimately involved with the release process
            to know where fixes are and where fixes should be landed.
         </p>

         <h3>The merge between release repos should be automatic</h3>
         <p>
            When the time comes to merge upstream release repositories with
            downstream repositories we are essentially replacing the downstream
            repository with a copy of the upstream. Because the
            merge/clone should never fail and it happens on a set schedule it
            will likely be automated.
        </p>
        <p>Please note in the section above there is still discussion on
        what can be automated and the proper version control mechanics.
        </p>
        <h3>Preffing off / backing out happens after the clone</h3>
        <p>
           When cloning from mozilla-central to mozilla-aurora
           the backouts and pref offs take place on the mozilla-aurora
           repo. This allows mozilla-central to use the complete allotted time
           for development and utilizes mozilla-aurora's time for
           convergence.
